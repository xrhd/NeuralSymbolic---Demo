## Michalskiâ€™s train problem

* Assume ten railway trains: five are travelling east and five are travelling west; each train comprises a locomotive pulling wagons; whether a particular train is travelling towards the east or towards the west is determined by some properties of that train

* The learning task: determine what governs which kinds of trains are Eastbound and which kinds are Westbound
